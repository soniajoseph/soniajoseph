# I'm experimenting with publically blogging about my decision-making

I've decided to be more public about my decision processes and brainstorming at this stage in life, opposed to operating in stealth. The upside is that I'll get more clear feedback on my direction, which enables faster course-correction. The downside is that I could choose to do something unpopular and contrarian, and the feedback could erode at my morale. Or, I make some major errors of reasoning and look a bit silly in the process, but I increasingly do not mind.

# Moving to Montreal after the Bay

I recently moved to Montreal to research reinforcement learning at Mila, the largest academic institute of machine learning. After several years immersed in startup culture in the Bay, the cultural switch was interesting.

Some observations:
* Some talented researchers here are interested in startups but confused as to where to begin. Some researchers also seemed to think that you have to be way more technically skilled than you actually have to be to start a company-- e.g. you have to finish your CS PhD before starting a company. Some people thought Sam Altman had an AI PhD from Stanford (he doesn't, he dropped out of Stanford as an undergrad). I think this comes from confusing value hierarchies. In science, competence is signalled through publications and completing a PhD is a big deal. However, in startups, if you're starting a company this stuff matters way less.
* There are several cultural assumptions in the Bay Area that make starting a company easier: in many communities, you're simply expected to do it eventually. Networks are incredibly dense: within your graph clique, you feel like everyone really does know everyone. Your friends are a jumble of founders, VCs, engineers, and researchers. Risk tolerance and friendliness are both high, which leads to both companies and cults.
* Billionaire funding is seen as very bizarre by many Canadians, who actually seem to trust their government. Some researchers want more profitable companies to arise from their labs so that the government pours more funding into AI. This thinking differs from that in the Bay Area, where some researchers start companeis with the hope of independently funding their research through private investors or profits.
* I've found the startup community here to be very open-minded. I have not raised in Montreal though I hear that valuations are far lower than those in the US.
