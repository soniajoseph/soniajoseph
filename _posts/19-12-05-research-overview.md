*In progress.*

This research overview focuses on current researchers with at least two of the following criteria:
1. Studying intelligence from both biological and artificial perspectives.
2. Heavy mathematical/computational focus (including machine learning). 
3. High level of abstraction on Marr's levels.
4. Focus on data analysis over collection.
5. Developing neurotechnology.
