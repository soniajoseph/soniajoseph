*Update: Applications are now closed, but feel free to email me if you'd like to connect for a future journal club.* 

Our Summer 2020 Reinforcement Learning Journal Club was a success, so we're excited to found another one. I'm starting a biweekly journal club focused on women in AI and modern NLP techniques with [Pujaa Rajan](https://www.pujaarajan.com/). Apply to join [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LCqxx_mZ3SbJjxX31oTxMn1GyDhq5556PWEsSBJ2QVo/edit)!
