One point of confusion in neuroscience is clearly defining the purpose of the modeling, which determines the model's level of abstraction. Especially in a field so young and quickly growing, it is important that researchers have a unified framework grounded in the [philosophy of modeling](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/). Bassett, Zurn & Gold clearly provide an extremely clear "cube-like" scaffolding for modeling with three axes: data representation vs first-principles based, structural realism vs functional phenomenology, and elementary descriptions vs coarse-grained approximiations. This paper gave me immense clarity in contextualizing other papers and touched upon fascinating concepts like graph-based meta-modeling.
