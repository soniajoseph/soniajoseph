**Bassett, D. S., Zurn, P., & Gold, J. I. (2018). On the nature and use of models in network neuroscience. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 19(9), 566â€“578. doi:10.1038/s41583-018-0038-8** Link [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-018-0038-8).

This review is immensely clarifying. One point of confusion in neuroscience is clearly defining the purpose of the modeling, which determines the model's level of abstraction. Especially in a field so young and quickly growing, researchers must have a unified framework grounded in the [philosophy of modeling](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/). In this review Bassett, Zurn & Gold clearly provide a clear "cube-like" scaffolding for modeling with three axes: *data representation vs first-principles based, structural realism vs functional phenomenology*, and *elementary descriptions vs coarse-grained approximations*. This paper also touches upon fascinating concepts like graph-based meta-modeling using its three-axes framework.
