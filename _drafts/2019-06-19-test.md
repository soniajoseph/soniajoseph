How does behavior emerge from billions of neurons firing? Recently, multi-neuron recordings have led to large advances in systems neuroscience. These papers explore neural dynamics in theoretical and experimental contexts, with a focus on how single-neuron recordings collectively give insight to higher-order behavior.
