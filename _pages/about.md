Hello! My name is Sonia Joseph.

I studied computer science, computational neuroscience, and literature at Princeton (Class of 2019), and wrote my thesis on natural language processing and semantic representation in the human brain. Previously, I held positions at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, the Harvard Data Science Initiative, and Ruane, Cunniff, and Goldfarb. Currently, I am a machine learning engineer in the Bay Area.

My primary interest is intelligence from both artificial and biological perspectives.
