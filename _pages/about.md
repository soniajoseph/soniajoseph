<!-- 
Hi, my name is Sonia Joseph. I am a graduate of Princeton University where I studied computational neuroscience, computer science, anthropology, and creative writing. My senior theses were on machine learning models of semantic representation in the human brain, advised by Uri Hasson, and a book titled *Polly*, advised by Aleksandar Hemon. My past experience includes the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, the Harvard Evolutionary Psychology Lab, and the investment firm Ruane, Cunniff and Goldfarb.

I am interested in human and non-human intelligences, and the principles by which they operate.
