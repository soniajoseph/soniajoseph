## Intro

I am interested in intelligence from both artificial and biological perspectives. In looking for fundamental principles of information processing, I draw inspiration from the brain, our proof-of-concept for general intelligence.

Currently, I am an incoming grad student at [Blake Richards' lab](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/blake-richards-phd) at [Mila Quebec](https://mila.quebec/en/).

Previously, I researched deep learning models on neural data at the [Stringer Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/stringer-lab) at Janelia, and sometimes collaborate with [FOR.ai](https://for.ai/), a multi-disciplinary AI research group. I was also a ML/NLP research engineer at the search engine startup [NLMatics](https://blogs.nlmatics.com/), and consultant for various ML startups in the Bay Area.

## Background 

I studied computer science, computational neuroscience, and literature at Princeton University (Class of 2019), and wrote my thesis on natural language processing models for semantic representation in the human brain. Previously, I held positions at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/), the [Harvard Data Science Initiative](https://datascience.harvard.edu/), and [Ruane, Cunniff, and Goldfarb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruane,_Cunniff_%26_Goldfarb). I also worked as a machine learning and natural language processing consultant for startups in the Bay Area. Before Janelia, I was a ML/NLP research engineer at the search engine startup [NLMatics](https://www.nlmatics.com/).

I live in Palo Alto, CA, near Stanford's campus. My favorite hobbies are dog training and writing science-fiction.


## About this website

This website contains literature reviews, essays, projects, and coding experiments. Not all the work on here is polished, but I would rather my website be a living laboratory that reflects my latest thoughts. Some representative posts include my [introduction to Hopfield networks](https://soniajoseph.github.io/computational%20neuroscience/neural-dynamics-primer/) and [novel coding experiments into the semantic similarity of phrases](https://soniajoseph.github.io/machine%20learning/semantic-similarity-search-phrases/).
