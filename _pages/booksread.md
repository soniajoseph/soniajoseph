1. *Wake Up and Live* - Dorothea Brande. 19th century style, simple, powerful. A book to tile your mind with.
> “Act boldly and unseen forces will come to your aid.”
>
> “Act as if it were impossible to fail.”

2. *Alignment* - Less Wrong Community. AI safety essays that were previously online take on a new seriousness in printed form.
