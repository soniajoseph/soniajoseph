<p>I’ve decided to be more public about my decision processes and brainstorming at this stage in life, opposed to operating in stealth.</p>

<p>The upside is that I’ll get more clear feedback on my direction, which enables faster course-correction.</p>

<p>The downside is that I do something unpopular and contrarian, and the feedback could erode at my morale. Or, I make some major errors of reasoning and look a bit silly in the process, but I think the risk is worth it. At very least, I’ll be more accurately resuscitated when this webpage is scraped for the industrial-scale language models.</p>

<p><em>Note: these thoughts are stream-of-consciousness, with minimal editing, and may contain grammatical and spelling errors. Find my polished thoughts elsewhere.</em></p>

<h2 id="moving-to-montreal-after-the-bay">Moving to Montreal after the Bay</h2>

<p>I recently moved to Montreal to research reinforcement learning at Mila, the largest academic institute of machine learning. After several years immersed in startup culture in the Bay, the cultural switch was interesting.</p>

<h3 id="some-observations">Some observations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Researchers not familiar with startups evaluate their possible startup competence on researcher hierarchies.</strong> Many talented researchers here are interested in startups but confused as to where to begin. Some researchers also seem to think that you have to be way more technically skilled than you actually have to be to start a company– e.g. you have to finish your CS PhD before starting a company. Someone thought Sam Altman had an AI PhD from Stanford (he doesn’t, he dropped out of Stanford as an undergrad). I think this impression comes from confusing value hierarchies. In science, competence is signalled through publications and completing a PhD is a big deal. However, in startups, if you’re starting a company this stuff matters way less. What matters more is your ability to recruit talented people to join you, raise capital, and coordinate the show.</li>
  <li><strong>Why Bay Area culture makes the place conducive for startups.</strong> There are several cultural assumptions in the Bay Area that make starting a company easier: in many communities, you’re simply expected to do it eventually. Networks are incredibly dense: within your graph clique, you feel like everyone really does know everyone. Your friends are a jumble of founders, VCs, engineers, and researchers. Risk tolerance and friendliness are both high, which leads to both companies and cults.</li>
  <li><strong>Government vs billionaire funding.</strong> Billionaire funding is seen as very bizarre by many Canadians, who actually seem to trust their government. Some researchers want more profitable companies to arise from their labs so that the government pours more funding into AI. This thinking differs from that in the Bay Area, where some researchers start companies with the hope of independently funding their research through private investors or through revenue.</li>
  <li>I’ve found the startup community here to be very welcoming and open-minded. I have not raised funding in Montreal though I hear that valuations are far lower than those in the US.</li>
  <li>The government subsidizes a huge slew of programs to make hiring interns pretty inexpensive for early-stage founders.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-found-next-stay-in-ai-enter-web-3-frontier-or-something-else">What to found next: stay in AI, enter web 3 frontier, or something else?</h2>

<p>I’m exploring the startup space as to what to fund next. I’m torn between staying in my field (AI) and making a bid in web 3.</p>

<p>Philosophically, I am aligned with creating AI companies to explore the nature of intelligence as a fundamentally important metaphysical question that is dear to my heart. My research and engineering background sit at the intersection of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence: I’ve worked for neuro labs and search companies.</p>

<p>However, AI is maturing as a sector. My personality loves emerging sectors. I love the questioning of all fundamental assumptions and rederiving structures that exist in the world. In conversations with friends about DAOs, we end up rederiving existing corporate structures: <em>so that’s why things are the way they are.</em></p>

<p>In web 3, I also smell more potential upside. However, investing huge amounts of time into web 3 is more aligned with philosophically questioning the nature of government, incentives, mechanism design. All good stuff, except my aesthetic preferences lean toward the nature of intelligence.</p>

<h3 id="to-financially-optimize">To financially optimize?</h3>

<p>The other variable is whether to financially optimize– not for personal wealth, but enough to significantly become a significant player and invest in bets that no one else would otherwise invest in. Given that 84% of EA is funded by mega-billionaires, I suspect that financially optimizing would increase the preference-set of things that are funded.</p>

<p><em>On EA</em>
Effective Altruism calls this model “earn to give.” In 2016 when I was more enmeshed with the community, I got the impression “earn to give” meant take a stable job and invest 20% of your income. However, friends who are more embedded in the movement tell me that times are changing and EA members recognize the startup world’s power law.</p>

<p>Thus it’s not clear to me why EA hasn’t founded something like Y-Combinator which gets most of its return from the power law unicorn of AirBnB. An EA-adjacent friend hypothesizes that entrepreneurs “like secret knowledge” and EA doesn’t feel very “secret” anymore– so this may be an aesthetic preference.</p>

<p><em>Which companies optimize most financially?</em>
If financially optimizing is the play, the next question is which companies would be the most profitable if created. I’m steadily looking at the DeFi sector, but we’re in a web 3 bull run and the market is quickly saturating. It’s hard to fully assess because the space as ballooned rapidly very quickly. To gather more data about web 3 as a bet, I’ve joined communities like KERNEL and will soon be spending some time in NYC.</p>

<p>Staying in AI, bets that are both financially and philosophically aligned look like building an industrial-scale language model, screen capture, or some other company with giant amounts of data and compute. It’s not obvious to me why GPT-3 has basically zero US competitors. However, the outcome here looks pretty cleanly like “get acquihired by Google or Microsoft” and it’s not clear that this is a great outcome. AI is a maturing and gated world where web 3 is not.</p>

<p><strong>The tl;dr is that AI is philosophically aligned and profitable, but web 3 could be far more profitable, and while less aligned with my philosophy, more aligned with my personality.</strong></p>

<h2 id="break-from-ea">Break from EA</h2>

<p>I’ve been writing a lot in stealth about transhumanism, and new types of movements cephalized around this body of ideas. Over the past decade, EA has dominated as a main aggregator of transhumanist thought. There are probably thousands of smaller transhumanist communities embedded about the world that I’m less familiar with, including startup/VC communities that invest in deeptech but don’t explicitly identify as transhumanist.</p>

<p>I’m interested in creating a movement that’s decorrelated from Effective Altruism to variance max value systems in the space. I notice fear in doing so (“what will the old guard transhumanists think?”) but increasingly, I am realizing the possible upside, if done well, is worth it.</p>

<p>In writing the whitepaper for the movement, I face the balance between artistic (Nietzsche) and academic. There are strong trade-offs between the two. Religious-esque blog writing is no longer as fashionable as dry-sounding whitepapers– perhaps we live in a hyperrationalistic age.</p>

<h1 id="radical-meta-learning-paper-group">Radical Meta-Learning Paper Group</h1>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong><em>What is the purpose of this reading group?</em></strong></p>

<p>There is a trend for algorithms to move away from handcrafted parameters and toward minimizing the human-specified inductive bias as much as possible. Meta-learning is a continuation of this trend.</p>

<p>In this reading group, we want to gain a deep understanding of “radical” meta-learning, i.e., algorithms that learn how to learn how to learn – and on till the nth meta-level.</p>

<p><strong><em>Why “radical”?</em></strong></p>

<p>“Radical” is a word taken from Jurgen Schmidhuber to distinguish this branch of meta-learning from current transfer learning techniques (e.g. MAML). For example, this difference could be between learning gradient descent itself (radical meta-learning) and optimizing gradient descent across many data distributions (a type of meta-learning / transfer learning). We want to study the first camp: learning as much of the algorithm as possible from scratch.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do I join?</em></strong></p>

<p>Shoot a quick email to Sonia Joseph at smjoseph@alumni.princeton.edu</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the format?</em></strong></p>

<p>One person will sign up to present a paper, which everyone will read. We’ll collectively take notes on a Google doc before and during the presentation. The presenter will go through the paper, and we’ll liberally discuss along the way. Some of the papers are long, so please feel free to come anyway even if you haven’t finished it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/FMNIST.png" width="500" class="center" /></p>

<p>Hopfield networks are fascinating one-shot data-denoisers. We train the network to “remember” the top row of fashion MNIST images using Hebbian learning. The network does not store the actual image, but encodes information of the image in its weights.</p>

<p>Then, we add noise to the image, randomly setting 30% of the pixels to the opposite value. When we feed each random image into the pre-trained Hopfield network, we get the original image back (bottom row)!</p>

The latter fascinates me, acting as a proof-of-concept for various facets of intelligence. And so it is unsuprising that my encounter with neural nets in college sent me away from molecular neuroscience and deep into foundational AI.</p>

<h1 id="the-goal-driven-technique">The Goal-Driven Technique</h1>

<p>One technique that falls into this latter camp is the “goal-driven”, or “normative” deep learning method. Instead of fitting your deep learning model directly to neural data, you train the model on a task that the neural substrate performs. Then, you compare the internal representations between the artificial model with the neural data. If the internal representations correlate throughout the model, then your model may be biologically plausible.</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted to understand the visual stream, I could train a deep CNN to recognize images. Then, I could compare the representations throughout the layers of that artificial neural net to neuron responses in the hierarchy of a macaque visual stream. Because the same problem only has so many solutions, certain artificial neural nets will find a solution that is mathematically analogous to that of the biological visual stream.</p>

<p>This approach has a major advantage over past methods in that the researcher does not have to manually set the parameters of the model. Rather, the parameters emerge organically after optimizing the model to perform a given task. And perhaps most importantly, not only do the outputs of the model correlate with its biological counterpart; the internal representations of the model also match the biology, without any explicit training on neural data. The model is not a black-box: it is interpretable, in that layers of the CNN <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8619">map onto layers of the biological visual stream in terms of predictivity</a>.</p>

<p>We can examine these task-optimized artificial neural nets further. Perhaps they are similar to the brain in ways that are hard to study in a wet lab, and so they can act as inexpensive models for “virtual” lesion and electrophysiology studies.</p>

<p>Of course, we must also exercise caution– neural nets and the brain are complex systems, so vastly different internal configurations can lead to the same final outcome. However, with the correct interpretation, this method will lead to rapid advances in our understanding of the brain.</p>

<p>Below I’ve compiled a list of potential research directions in which to take the goal-driven method.</p>

<h1 id="potential-research-directions">Potential Research Directions</h1>

<h2 id="sparsity">Sparsity</h2>

<p>It is well-known that representations in the brain are highly <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22579264/">sparse</a>. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03635.pdf">Lottery Ticket Hypothesis</a>, written more about <a href="https://soniajoseph.github.io/pruning/">here</a>, shows that neural nets can retain most of their accuracy depite losing 99% of their weights. Thus fascinating questions arise whether neural pruning mechanisms like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21778362/">microglia</a> can be modeled by sparsifying artificial neural nets.</p>

<h2 id="movies-environments-and-naturalistic-vision">Movies, Environments, and Naturalistic Vision</h2>

<p>Image datasets are limited in that they do not approximate naturalistic vision, which operates in a 3D environment through time. To give rise to maximally biologically-plausible architectures, it is likely that the model will have to be optimized to recognize objects in a 3D environment that it can interact with. Recent research shows that <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhuang_Unsupervised_Learning_From_Video_With_Deep_Neural_Embeddings_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf">unsupervised learning on video is a promising approach</a>.</p>

<p>More broadly, I suspect that unsupervised methods like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709">SimCLR</a> will become default when using the goal-driven method. Unsupervised methods do not need langauage, as organisms do not necessarily need language to learn categories.</p>

<h2 id="intermediate-gabor-patches">Intermediate “Gabor Patches”</h2>

<figure>

<p>Applying gradient descent (<a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">“DeepDream”</a>) on the original image is one method to visualize the stimulus that maximally activates a given neuron of an artificial neural net. Just as Gabor patches drive neural activity in the early layers of the biological visual stream, can visualizations like the one above drive neural activity in intermediate layers of the model’s biological counterpart?</p>

<h2 id="ventrolateral-pfc-in-object-recognition">Ventrolateral PFC in Object Recognition</h2>

<p>The role of the PFC in object recognition is poorly understood, but the area is suspected to encode <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12122406_Freedman_DJ_Riesenhuber_M_Poggio_T_Miller_EK_Categorical_representation_of_visual_stimuli_in_the_primate_prefrontal_cortex_Science_291_312-316">behaviorally relevant information about the object</a>. Some evidence suggests that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) is involved in top-down processes that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17071109/">aid object recognition</a> and contain <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03885-004">small populations of domain-specific neurons sensitive to eyes, faces, and words</a>.</p>

<p>One idea is measuring neural response in the vlPFC to an artificial neural net trained on images. We can then manipulate the stimuli to measure activations in the vlPFC. If our goal-driven model is predictive of responses, we can check whether the intermediate layers are also predictive of IT, V4, V2, and V1, in line with the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8619">original findings for the IT</a>.</p>

<p><em>Read more about using goal-driven neural nets on the prefrontal cortex <a href="https://soniajoseph.github.io/computational%20neuroscience/deep-learning-models-prefrontal-cortex/">here</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="mapping-out-architecture-space-capsulenets">Mapping Out Architecture Space: CapsuleNets</h2>

<p>Which neural net architectures have the highest predictivity of neural response? Is the architecture biologically plausible?</p>

<p>One interesting candidate is CapsuleNets. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8619">Previous studies</a> focus on comparing the internal representation of CNNs to that of the visual stream. However, in failing to encode the spatial relationships between features, CNNs lose biological plausibility. Hinton et al created <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829">CapsuleNets</a> as one candidate for a more biologically plausible model.</p>

<p>It’s possible that the activity vectors and dynamic routing of CapsuleNets provide a more biologically plausible mechanism than the normalization, pooling, thresholding, and convolutions of CNNs. One promising avenue is using the goal-driven method to compare the the similarity between task-optimized CapsuleNets and CNNs to biological neural responses. If CapsuleNets are more predictive of neural response, that may speak favorably for their biological plausibility.</p>

<h2 id="performance-and-predictiveness-the-upside-down-u-shape">Performance and Predictiveness: the Upside-Down U-shape</h2>

<p>Artificial neural nets do not necessarily face the same biological constraints as brains. One example may be an architecture like ResNets, which improves image classification performance but may not be biologically plausible with its long skip-connections.</p>

<p>Thus it is not surprising that the top-performing neural nets on image classification <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet">surpass human-level performance</a>. One hypothesis is that the relationship between performance on image classification and predictivity of neural activity follows an upside-down U-shape. Neural nets that are better at image classification will correlate more strongly with IT response– until an inflection point, when the neural net will surpass biological limitations. From thereon I expect that the correlation to IT response will decrease.</p>

<h2 id="integration-with-energy-based-models">Integration with Energy-Based Models</h2>

<p>Long used as <a href="https://bi.snu.ac.kr/Courses/g-ai09-2/hopfield82.pdf">models for associative memory</a>, energy-based models like Boltzmann machines and Hopfield networks are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">slowly making a comeback in modern deep learning</a>. It would be interesting to examine hybrids between deep learning models and energy-based models as biologically plausible candidates.</p>

<h1 id="more-resources">More Resources</h1>

<p>Some good overviews of the goal-driven paradigm are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4244">this original 2014 paper</a>, and <a href="https://oxfordre.com/neuroscience/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264086.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264086-e-46">this 2019 overview</a>.</p>

<p>The technique is flourishing in computational neuroscience labs across the world, so I will be missing many labs if I merely listed the ones I knew.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a more detailed, hands-on introduction to goal-driven neural nets, Carsen Stringer’s <a href="https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/tutorials/W3D4_DeepLearning1/W3D4_Tutorial3.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> under Neuromatch Academy is an unrivaled resource. Other notebooks in the series also include detailed tutorials on the basics of machine learning and PyTorch.</p>

The idea is simple: find the word embedding for each word using an algorithm like word2vec or GloVe, average the embeddings together to get a sentence vector, and match sentences with the most similar sentence vectors based off Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.</p>

<p>I recently became interested in extending the idea to the phrase level. If we have two sentences, can we co-locate all the semantically similar phrases from each sentence?</p>

<p>For example, if I have the following two sentences:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sentence A:  Yucaipa owned Dominick’s before selling the chain to Safeway in 1998 for $2.5 billion.</p>

  <p>Sentence B:  Yucaipa bought Dominick’s in 1995 for $693 million and sold it to Safeway for $1.8 billion in 1998.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want my algorithm to return similar phrases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yucaipa owned Dominick’s” / “Yucapia bought Dominick’s”</p>

  <p>“selling the chain to Safeway” / “sold it to Safeway”</p>

  <p>“in 1998 for $2.5 billion” / “for $1.8 billion in 1998”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To accomplish this, I wrote an algorithm with the following steps:</p>

<p>1) Parse the sentence into phrases using a statistical dependency parser.</p>

<p>2) Create a word vector average for each phrase using word2vec embeddings.</p>

<p>3) Match the most similar phrases based off closest Euclidean distance between word vector averages.</p>

<p>I’ve explained the steps with code in the blog post below, and you can find a Jupyter notebook <a href="https://github.com/soniajoseph/phrase-similarity">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="lets-write-a-function-to-calculate-a-semantic-measure-for-the-phrase">Let’s write a function to calculate a semantic measure for the phrase.</h2>

<p>Now we need a metric to calculate the semantic measure of each phrase. I calculate the word vector of each word of the phrase and then average the words together. Notably, I did not normalize the word vectors before averaging because the different lengths give rise to a weighted average, which <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09209.pdf">Arefyev et al suggests is more accurate</a>.</p>

<p>While research regarding weighted vs unweighted word vector averages is scarce, one theory is that infrequent words are correlated with longer word vectors. Infrequent words may be more poorly represented by the embedding, which is based off distributional frequency, and so having a larger value in the total average may make the overall phrase vector more accurate.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">wva</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">):</span>

    Finds document vector through an average of each word's vector.

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we will calculate the phrases with the greatest semantic similarity. The most common measures of semantic similarity are cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. Perhaps unconventionally, I chose the latter in order to capture the information in the word average lengths, which Arefyez et al. suggest is significant in representing word frequency.</p>

<p>To improve the function, we could train a dependency parser on the corpus to extract better phrases. We could also experiment with other ways of traversing the existing tree and trying other similarity measures, including cosine similarity, Mahalanobis distance, and relaxed word mover’s distance.</p>

<p>I am also interested in experimenting with accuracy in normalized vs. unnormalized word vector averages and the relationship between vector length and word frequency.</p>

<p><em>This project was done as a challenge for <a href="for.ai">for.ai</a>, a multi-disciplinary distributed artificial intelligence research collaboration. I entered the challenge with minimal background in pruning neural nets and consulted the literature only post-experiment.</em></p>

<p><em>The full code on GitHub is <a href="https://github.com/soniajoseph/Pruning">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Pruning is deleting connections in a neural net in order to improve generalization and reduce computational resources. Two kinds of pruning exist: weight-pruning, in which the largest weights by absolute value are set to zero; and unit-pruning, in which the smallest neurons are set to zero by a vector-wise metric like L2-norm.</p>

<p>Here, I examine the relationship between pruning and accuracy on a vanilla neural net. Before running any experiments, I hypothesize that accuracy for the pruned neural net will slightly rise (due to the regularization), and then have a negative linear correlation with the amount pruned. I also hypothesize that unit-pruning, in deleting entire neurons instead of individual weights, will have a more dramatic negative effect than weight-pruning.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-pre-literature-review">Discussion (pre-literature review)</h2>

<p>Clearly, my hypothesis that accuracy will rise and then negatively correlate in a roughly linear way with pruning was incorrect. The figure instead shows a dramatic nonlinear relationship between accuracy and pruning. Accuracy remains roughly constant until dropping off at about 75% sparsity for weight-pruning and until 70% sparsity for unit-pruning. My hypothesis that unit-pruning impacts accuracy more dramatically than weight-pruning held up.</p>

<p>These results are fascinating: Less than 25% of the neural net represents important information about its function. The data also suggest that accuracy may slightly increase with a light amount of pruning (~30%), although I would run on more iterations with a larger dataset to be sure. It would make sense that keeping the net’s smaller weights reduces its generalization.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h2>

<p>Let’s turn to existing papers to get a better grasp on the pruning phenomenon.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03635.pdf">“The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis”</a>, the authors put forth the idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A randomly-initialized, dense neural network contains a subnetwork that is initialized such that—when trained in isolation—it can match the test accuracy of the
original network after training for at most the same number of iterations.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Pruning the network automatically finds the “winning ticket” subnetwork, whose accuracy is comparable to that of the fully trained net. The idea is similar to the one proposed in <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-90b.pdf">“Optimal Brain Damage”</a> (which is very strangely named, given that dropout is more similar to synaptic pruning in healthy brains than conventional brain damage), in which the authors prune a network based on second-derivative information.</p>

<h2 id="further-directions">Further Directions</h2>

<p>Questions remain. The theory behind the pruning-accuracy relationship remains an ongoing area of research. Are there other ways of finding these “winning ticket” subnetworks besides pruning (e.g. directly from the objective function)? Why does one have to train a largely overparameterized network first in order for the winning ticket to arise? Can we find winning ticket subnetwork before training the full network (i.e. during training)?</p>

<p>I am also curious if CNNs, RNNs, and ResNets show the same relationship between pruning and accuracy as the vanilla NN examined here. I am interested in the effect of pruning the weights by magnitude of the entire net (opposed to layer by layer), and using magnitude measures other than absolute value and L2-norm. And what about deleting the largest weights and neurons, opposed to the smallest?</p>

<p>Lastly, I am interested in pruning artificial nets to computationally model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_pruning">synaptic pruning</a> with microglia in biological brains. Synaptic pruning may conserve biological resources, improve brain functioning, or both.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;assets/images/avatar.png&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;computer science&lt;br&gt;computational neuroscience&lt;br&gt;&amp; machine learning&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;soniamollyjoseph@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;title_separator&quot;=&gt;&quot;-&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;About&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://soniajoseph.github.io/about/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://medium.com/@soniamollyjoseph&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fas fa-fw fa-link&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/soniamjoseph/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Twitter&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Facebook&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-facebook-square&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/soniajoseph&quot;}], &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Princeton, NJ&quot;}</name><email>soniamollyjoseph@gmail.com</email></author><category term="projects" /><category term="machine learning" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When pruning 80% of a neural net does not affect accuracy]]></summary></entry></feed>
